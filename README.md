# Hemorrhage detection using CNN and Transfer Learning

## Project Overview
This project implements a deep learning-based binary classification model to detect the presence of hemorrhage in medical images. The model is trained on Dataset1 and evaluated on both Dataset1 and Dataset2, followed by fine-tuning experiments to assess cross-dataset performance.

## Motivation
This project was done as a part of my DS261 assignment.

## Key Features

+ Binary classification of hemorrhage presence/absence
+ Cross-dataset evaluation
+ Transfer learning and fine-tuning experiments
+ Performance metrics analysis (precision, recall, f1-score)
